# Terraform-Assignment

The following code is used to create an EC2 instance with a security group in a VPC.
The one problem that I faced with this code is when I don't connect VPC then the code works fine but in the presence of VPC, code show one error. I tried fixing it multiple times but couldn't resolve it.
The resouces that are included are- EC2, VPC, Public and Private subnet, Internet Gateway, Routing table and security group.
